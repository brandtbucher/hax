HAX lets you write compiled bytecode inline with pure Python. It was originally
built for exploring new improvements to CPython's compiler and peephole
optimizer.

Installation
------------

HAX supports CPython 3.7+ on all platforms.

To install, just run:

```sh
$ pip install hax
```

Example
-------

Consider the following function; it accepts a sequence of items, and returns a
list with each item repeated twice:

```py
def doubled(items):
    out = []
    for item in items:
        out += item, item
    return out
```

For example, `doubled((0, 1, 2))` returns `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.

We can make this function faster by keeping `out` on the stack (instead of in a
local variable) and using the `LIST_APPEND` op to build it. HAX makes it
simple to inline these instructions:

```py
from hax import *

@hax
def doubled(items):

    BUILD_LIST(0)

    for item in items:

        LOAD_FAST("item")
        DUP_TOP()
        LIST_APPEND(3)
        LIST_APPEND(2)

    RETURN_VALUE()
```

With the help of labeled jump targets (`HAX_LABEL`), the function can be further
sped up by rewriting the for-loop in bytecode, removing _all_ temporary
variables, and operating **entirely on the stack**:

```py
from hax import *

@hax
def doubled(items):

    BUILD_LIST(0)

    LOAD_FAST("items")
    GET_ITER()
    HAX_LABEL("loop")
    FOR_ITER("return")

    DUP_TOP()
    LIST_APPEND(3)
    LIST_APPEND(2)
    JUMP_ABSOLUTE("loop")

    HAX_LABEL("return")
    RETURN_VALUE()
```

It's important to realize that the functions HAX provides (`BUILD_LIST`,
`LOAD_FAST`, ...) aren't just "emulating" their respective bytecode
instructions; the `@hax` decorator detects them, and completely recompiles
`doubled`'s code to use the _actual_ ops that we've specified here!

These performance improvements are impossible to get from CPython's compiler and
optimizer alone.
